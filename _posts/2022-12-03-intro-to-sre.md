title: "Intro to SRE for Founders - a 6 week email-based course"
published: true

I've decided to try something new, and launch an email course for the first time. I don't have a big audience, but this is something I've been thinking about for a while and that I think many people could benefit from. The course is called Intro to SRE for Founders, and it's designed to teach the basics of site reliability engineering to startup founders. In the course course, you'll learn about the basics of SRE, including key concepts and principles. You'll also learn about tools and techniques for monitoring and incident management, and how to implement best practices for SRE in your company.

The course is based on my own experiences as an SRE at Google, as well as my experiences building a startup from scratch with SRE principles in mind. I'll be sharing my own learnings and insights with you, and providing you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed with SRE in your own startup.

The way the course works is that each week you'll receive a new email that covers a different topic in detail. The emails are easy to read and understand, and are designed to provide you with a step-by-step introduction to SRE. Each week's email is around 1000-1500 words, so it's digestible but also informative.

So, if you're ready to learn more about SRE and how it can help your startup, sign up for my 6-week email-based introduction to SRE course today! You'll get access to all 6 weekly emails, plus any additional content on this topic I decide to write and add down the line. Be one of the first people to sign up with this link and you'll get the course for the alpha-tester price of $10: https://course.joepetrich.com/products/6-week-intro-to-sre?promo=FIRST10. I'd love your feedback and to make this something that can help many founders down the road.
